            <p class="sectionText">
                When I wrote my first line of vba four years ago, I didn't think of it as the first step to a career in software development; I was a project accountant at the time and my initial intention was no more lofty than creating a macro to hide some columns on an oversized Excel table. But in the weeks and months that followed, I started looking for more ways to script the boring aspects my job. Through that process, I became the "vba expert" at my company (Menard USA, a design/build geotechnical engineering firm) and started writing bespoke excel apps for co-workers. More broadly, I became fascinated with software development and the ways it can be used to simplify rote tasks and organize complex processes. And looking around the different departments in Menard, I saw that even in Engineering and Operations, people were still using plain, unconnected excel files for most forms. I realized that there were a lot of opportunities to develop apps that could streamline things and centralize data into a web based relatinal database. And more to the point, I could be that developer. This is when my dev career began in earnest: I resolved to learn C# .NET and SQL and started developing apps for Menard on the weekends.

            <p class="sectionText">
                And it worked. After a year of writing custom apps around the company and finally catching the attention of our Engineering director, the company moved me to the newly created position of Software Developer for the R&D department. Since then, I have been able to build many of the projects I had envisioned for Menard when first starting out. Currently, I run a SQL database and  web api on Azure that serve as the back end for custom dashboards and apps including:

                    <p class="sectionText">I have built several production web services using C# and ASP.NET. The most notable example is Menard's web api, which is used as an interface for the database by many of my applications. Though the front end aspects of the api are fairly basic, I have a different web app that allows users to make edits to reference tables in our production tracking platform which uses bootstrap tables and layout.</p>

Examples include our payroll processing app, PM cost control app and the report aggregator program for our safety department, among others. This experience has made me familiar with the  MVVM design pattern and how to structure desktop applications with larger code bases.</p>

These include vba in macros and userforms, but also custom VSTO plug-ins and other C# based apps I have written to search, parse and complete other tasks on content in ms office format files.</p>

Our SQL database and web api run on the platform, and managing these resources on Azure is really at the core of what I do. I also have experience with some other Azure services that I have used for single purpose apps, like Azure Functions for automated updates.</p>
