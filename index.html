                When I wrote my first line of vba four years ago, I didn't think of it as the first step to a career in software development; I was a project accountant at the time and my initial intention was no more lofty than creating a macro to hide some columns on an oversized Excel table. But in the weeks and months that followed, I started looking for more ways to script the boring aspects my job. Through that process, I became the "vba expert" at my company (Menard USA, a design/build geotechnical engineering firm) and started writing bespoke excel apps for co-workers. More broadly, I became fascinated with software development and the ways it can be used to simplify rote tasks and organize complex processes. And looking around the different departments in Menard, I saw that even in Engineering and Operations, people were still using plain, unconnected excel files for most forms. I realized that there were a lot of opportunities to develop apps that could streamline things and centralize data into a web based relatinal database. And more to the point, I could be that developer. This is when my dev career began in earnest: I resolved to learn C# .NET and SQL and started developing apps for Menard on the weekends.

                And it worked. After a year of writing custom apps around the company and finally catching the attention of our Engineering director, the company moved me to the newly created position of Software Developer for the R&D department. Since then, I have been able to build many of the projects I had envisioned for Menard when first starting out. Currently, I run a SQL database and  web api on Azure that serve as the back end for custom dashboards and apps including:

            <p class="sectionBulletText">-Excel based apps that allow posting and editing of records to the database via api calls</p>
            <p class="sectionBulletText">-Dashboards and reporting applications for our design engineers</p>
            <p class="sectionBulletText">-Cost projection tools for our project managers that draw on data from Viewpoint and our production tracking platform</p>
