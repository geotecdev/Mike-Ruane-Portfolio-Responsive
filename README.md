# Mike-Ruane-Portfolio-Responsive


# application description
This application is a website with three static pages: an about page, a portfolio and a contact form.
These pages have details about Developer Mike Ruane, along with examples of some past work. It employs a 
number of bootstrap layouts so that the pages are responsive for smaller screens and mobile devices


# notes on the current version
-The CSS files are organized as follows: base classes and styles for index.html are in "mainStylesheet.css".
  the other pages have seperate stylesheets where for selectors that only apply to the corresponding page.
-code base uses semantic html wherever possible
-Alt tags have been added to all images and icons
